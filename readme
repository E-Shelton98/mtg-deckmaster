# MTG-Deckmaster(Backend)

MTG-Deckmaster is a passion project designed with the idea of helping fans of the popular trading card game Magic: The Gathering to create and share their decks, along with tracking deck statistics such as Win/Loss percentage and strength versus weakness against other deck types or players.

## Installation

This program is intended to be used in conjunction with the matching frontend application. Installation requires a few environmental keys for access to the development MongoDB. Besides that, you should be able to install all required dependencies with a simple npm install command.
```
npm install
```

## Usage

This application uses ScryFall API bulk data to create an external Mongo database for housing all of the various cards in Magic as well as creating and tracking player profiles, friend lists, and decks. 

### Known Bugs

Currently the application is having a problem with memory usage, it simply runs out of HEAP when deployed on Heroku or other hosting site.

### Future Feature Ideas

Currently there are none in the works, but open to suggestions.
